##**We Need Your Video Submissions**

We need you to submit video of yourself performing six short scripts. You can use your computer, your phone, or a video camera. 

__Recording__

Here is Wes performing the scripts. Please watch Wes and try to match his pacing and basic style. The goal is for the videos to be similar in composition and pace.

Please be sure to record in a quiet space, like a bedroom, with a neutral background. Your face should be the focus.

__Delivery, Or Getting That Video to US__

Youtube is our preferred method. Upload your video to your youtube channel and email the link to Matt Griffin (Video designer and coordinator for the show) at matt@mattgriffin.net

If you do not wish your video to be viewable on youtube without the direct link, choose "Unlisted" from the options when you upload. This way only people with the URL to the video will be able to watch it and it will not appear in YouTube searches. This is your choice. **Do not mark the video "Private"** or we will not be able to acquire it from YouTube.

If you have any questions, please email matt@mattgriffin.net with the subject "Doris Day Video - [Your Name]"

Thanks, and we hope to include you in this final faculty production in the Studio Theater. It will be fun.
